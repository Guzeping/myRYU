1、Making use of centralized control in SDN (Software Defined Network),reduce broadcast traffic in Ethernet, improve the scalability of Ethernet.
2、Responsible for designing, developing and testing the application. Write a paper about it.
3、Reduce broadcast traffic effectively by centralized handling ARP messages, introducing pending queue. The simulation results demonstrate that ARP proxy is transparent to hosts, effectively reduces ARP traffic to 7.1%, eliminates the broadcast storm
